Use any of the data filters `REGION`, `SUB-REGION`, `COUNTRY`, `AREA` to select a subset of the data.  
The filters selection is all-inclusive performing the union.  
> 
> For example, you can select `EUROPE` in the `REGION` filter and add the `US` in the `COUNTRY` filter.  
> 
> Leave filters `empty` to select the worldwide dataset.  
>  

The `COUNTRY` split is a geolocation split, not a political state.  

The `AREA` data is currently available for `US` states, `CHINA` provinces, `CANADA` and `AUSTRALIA`. 
The area data defaults to country-level for the other.

md2 = '''
Use the `SPLIT` dropdown list to show a split of the selected dataset.  
>
> For example, use `REGION` to show the timeline split by region. 
>

Use the `Limit Split to Top` field to condense the split information. An empty entry corresponds to no limit.  

The Data split view is shown when switching "on" the `Show Split Data`.  

Please note, when using the data split, the second `TAB` becomes available to show 
the COVID-19 statistics based on the most current data extract date.
